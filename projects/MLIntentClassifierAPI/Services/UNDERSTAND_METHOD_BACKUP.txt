===== BACKUP OF ORIGINAL Understand METHOD =====
Date: August 22, 2025
This is the original implementation before refactoring

public QueryUnderstanding Understand(string text)
{
    var intent = PredictIntent(text);
    // Get all employees as objects
    var allEmployeeObjects = typeof(EmployeeQueryOrchestrator)
        .GetField("Employees", System.Reflection.BindingFlags.NonPublic | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Static)
        ?.GetValue(null) as List<Employee> ?? new List<Employee>();
    var allEmployeeNames = allEmployeeObjects.Select(e => e.Name).ToList();
    // Build fuzzy list from all employee names
    var foundNames = ExtractNamesFromQuery(text, allEmployeeNames);
    Console.WriteLine($"Matched names: {string.Join(", ", foundNames)} for query: {text}");
    // Build slots after filtering names
    var slots = ExtractSlots(text, _domain, foundNames);

    // filteredEmployees is the list of Employee objects whose names were matched
    var filteredEmployees = allEmployeeObjects
        .Where(e => foundNames.Contains(e.Name, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        .ToList();

    return new QueryUnderstanding {
        Intent = intent,
        Slots = slots,
        // Employees = filteredEmployees,
    };
}

===== SUPPORTING METHODS (still available in the class) =====
- PredictIntent(string text)
- ExtractNamesFromQuery(string text, List<string> employeeNames)  
- ExtractSlots(string text, DomainDictionaries domain, List<string> foundNames)
- MapCanonical(string text, Dictionary<string,string> dict)
- ContainsAny(string text, params string[] terms)
- Normalize(string s)
- InitializeDomainDictionaries()

===== WHAT THE ORIGINAL METHOD DID =====
1. Predicted intent using ML model + fallback rules
2. Used reflection to get employee list from EmployeeQueryOrchestrator
3. Extracted employee names from query text using fuzzy matching
4. Built slots by parsing domain terms and dates
5. Filtered employees based on matched names
6. Returned QueryUnderstanding with intent, slots (and commented out employees)

===== NOTES FOR REFACTORING =====
- The reflection-based employee fetching might need to be replaced
- Name extraction logic could be simplified/improved
- Slot extraction might need restructuring based on new domain mappings
- Consider separating concerns (intent vs slots vs employees)
- The console logging might need to be replaced with proper logging



===== Next Steps ====
- Implement full name-matching in Understand using the repository's name variants, or
- Add an endpoint to expose QueryUnderstanding for quick API testing.
